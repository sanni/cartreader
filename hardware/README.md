### Important: This is still a work in progress and PCB files might contain errors.    

The Open Source Cart Reader consists out of a main PCB that connects an Arduino Mega to different modules and a cartridge slot adapter PCB.

To order a PCB you need to download the zipped gerber files and upload them to a PCB manufacturer like [JLCPCB](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote). You don't have to change any of the settings but you can select a color you like.

You can view the schematic and the PCB files using a free and open source programm called [KiCad](https://downloads.kicad.org/kicad/windows/explore/nightlies).   
To design your own adapters you can follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/sanni/cartreader/wiki/Designing-your-own-Adapters)
